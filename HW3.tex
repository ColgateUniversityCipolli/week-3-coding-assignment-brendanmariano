% QUESTION 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item This week's Problem of the Week in Math is described as follows:
\begin{quotation}
  \textit{There are thirty positive integers less than 100 that share a certain 
  property. Your friend, Blake, wrote them down in the table to the left. But 
  Blake made a mistake! One of the numbers listed is wrong and should be replaced 
  with another. Which number is incorrect, what should it be replaced with, and 
  why?}
\end{quotation}
The numbers are listed below.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    6 & 10 & 14 & 15 & 21\\
    22 & 26 & 33 & 34 & 35\\
    38 & 39 & 46 & 51 & 55\\
    57 & 58 & 62 & 65 & 69\\
    75 & 77 & 82 & 85 & 86\\
    87 & 91 & 93 & 94 & 95
    \label{vals}
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Use the fact that the ``certain'' property is that these numbers are all supposed
to be the product of \emph{unique} prime numbers to find and fix the mistake that
Blake made.\\
\textbf{Reminder:} Code your solution in an \texttt{R} script and copy it over
to this \texttt{.Rnw} file.\\
\textbf{Hint:} You may find the \verb|%in%| operator and the \verb|setdiff()| function to be helpful.\\

\textbf{Solution:} 
% Write your answer and explanations here.
